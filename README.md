# Linear Regression and TensorFlow

## Description
This code uses the numpy, pandas, sklearn and tensorflow. This particular type of machine learning algorithm that I used was **linear regression**. This program will take parameters such as a students first grade, second grade, absences, study time, and failures to predict the final grade the student will acheive. 

### Linear Regression
Linear regression will try and create a line of best fit between data points (in the form of _y=mx+b_) and works best when y and x have a direct correlation. Because data is never perfect in the real world (and usually represents a scatter plot) linear regression tries to solve this by finding the best possible line (by changing the m and b values) that goes through the data points. With the line of best fit found and say you wanted to predict the price of bananas in 2025 the program will plug 2020 into x and will give back y (which will be the predicted price of bananas in 2025).
- Linear regression not only works in 2 dimensions but also works in 3, 4, or more dimensions.

#### Future Steps and Notes
As this was just a beginnner tutorial to tensorflow and linear regression I would like to try to create my own dataset and try machine learning (using linear regression) on that. I can see many real world uses of linear regression such as climate change predictions. 

**Skills Learned:** Basic use of numpy, pandas, sklearn, and tensorflow.
