# Linear Regression and TensorFlow

## Description
I decided to explore TensorFlow and wanted to start with a tutorial to learn the basics. This code uses the numpy, pandas, sklearn and tensorflow. This particular type of machine learning algorithm that I used was **linear regression**. This program will take some parameter such as a students first grade, second grade, absences, and more to predict the final grade the student will acheive. 

### Linear Regression
Linear regression will try and create a line of best fit between data points (in the form of _y=mx+b_) and works best when y and x have a direct correlation. Because data is never perfect in the real world(and usually represents a scatter plot) linear regression tries to solve this by finding the best possible line (by changiun the m and b values) that goes through the data points. Now all the program needs to do is find the value you would like to find on the x axis and use the _y = mx + b_ equation to find the value of the y axis (which will be a prediciton).

#### Future Steps and Notes
As this was just a beginnner tutorial to tensorflow and linear regression I would like to try to create my own dataset and try machine learning (using linear regression) on that. I can see many real world uses of linear regression such as climate change predictions. 

**Skills Learned:** Basic use of numpy, pandas, sklearn, and tensorflow.
